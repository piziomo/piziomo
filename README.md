## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed an MSc in Big Data and Digital Futures at the University of Warwick, building on an earlier career in audiovisual (AV) systems design and project delivery. My path into data science was not linear, and that has shaped my approach: I think like both a designer and a researcher, balancing technical precision with the wider context of how people, organisations, and technology interact.

My technical strengths include Python, R, and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, alongside machine learning frameworks including TensorFlow and Keras. I have applied these to projects in time-series forecasting for electric vehicle charging, generative AI for data visualisation, biomedical image prediction, and the use of ensemble methods such as random forests and gradient boosting for structured data. What excites me most is when these models sit within well-designed systems that are interpretable, usable, and scalable. My years as a lead systems designer taught me how to design for people, manage teams, and deliver under strict timelines â€” lessons that now shape how I think about moving data science solutions from prototype to real-world impact.

Beyond the technical, I have led teams, managed interdisciplinary projects, and worked with stakeholders from policymakers to private companies. Whether coordinating AV automation projects across West Africa or developing participatory analytics frameworks for the UKâ€™s green economy, I have learned how to keep projects on track, communicate complex findings clearly, and foster collaboration across diverse disciplines.

Iâ€™m now looking for opportunities in data science, machine learning, or applied AI where I can bring together this mix of technical expertise, systems thinking, and project leadership. Iâ€™m particularly motivated by roles that use data not just to predict outcomes, but to guide smarter decisions and support change in areas like sustainability, innovation, and business strategy.
